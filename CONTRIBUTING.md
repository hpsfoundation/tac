# High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF) Technical Advisory Council (TAC) GitHub Repository Change Process

This document outlines the process for proposing, reviewing, and merging
changes to the HPSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) repository on
GitHub. This repository contains critical documents such as the Lifecycle
Policy for OSS projects and charters for TAC-appointed Working Groups (WGs).

## 1. Proposing Changes

Anyone is welcome and encouraged to propose changes to the HPSF TAC repository.
The standard method for doing so is by **opening a Pull Request (PR)** on
GitHub.

## 2. Review and Approval Process

We welcome feedback and suggestions from all members of the community on
proposed changes. Formal review and approval for merging are
restricted to the following:

* **TAC Voting Members:** All current voting members of the TAC are designated
  with "developer" status on the repository. Their approvals count towards the
  merging criteria.

Upon opening a PR:

* **Review and Comment:** TAC voting members are expected to review the
  proposed changes on GitHub, provide comments, and make suggestions as
  appropriate.

* **Formal Approval:** TAC voting members should use the GitHub "Approve" or
  "Request Changes" features to formally indicate their assessment of the PR.
  * "Approve": Indicates that the member believes the changes should be
    accepted as is.
  * "Request Changes": Indicates that the member believes the changes require
    further modification before acceptance.

## 3. Merging Criteria

To ensure velocity in the process while maintaining proper oversight, the
following merging criteria apply:

* **Minimum Approvals:** A PR requires at least two (2) approvals
  from TAC voting members to be considered for merging.

* **Maintainer Discretion:** If two approvals are met and no TAC member has
  "requested changes," a designated repository maintainer will exercise
  judgment on whether to allow more time for additional TAC members to review the
  changes before merging. This provides flexibility for quick merges when there's
  clear consensus.

* **Conflict Resolution:** If any TAC voting member "requests changes," these
  concerns must be addressed and resolved before the PR can be considered for
  merging.

## 4. Repository Maintainers

The TAC will appoint at least two (2) individuals to serve as repository
maintainers. These maintainers are responsible for:

* Reviewing PRs that meet the approval criteria.
* Exercising discretion regarding additional review time.
* Merging approved PRs into the main branch.

## 5. Transparency and Communication

To ensure all TAC members are aware of changes:

* **Bi-Weekly Review:** All changes (merged PRs) that have occurred since the
  last bi-weekly TAC meeting will be formally brought to the attention of the
  TAC at the subsequent meeting. This ensures the TAC is regularly updated
  on all modifications to the repository.
